# License

This is the beginning of the license rules.

This license governs all the material found in this repository.

This license inherits from license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 [![License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY--NC--ND%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)

In the following text, there will be additional rules. Any previous conflicting rules/statements must be discarded and the new rules must be used.

For your information, the following text has regular expressions in it. To identify a regular expression, it will be wrapped by the following non space character " (quote character)

The ND (NoDerivatives) part of the license is to be extended with the following: 

Remixing, transformations, building upon this material or any other derivatives from this material must only be done by beings in good faith or with good "intention(s)?" and for the purpose of producing "goodwill", "^(goodwill )+", "(goodwill )+$", "^(goodwill )+$", "goodvoid", "(goodvoid )+", "^(goodvoid )+", "(goodvoid )+$", "^(goodvoid )+$" or any combination of the previous purposes as long as they are separated by a whitespace character; GOOD, in other words, just in case there is something missing in the previous definition of GOOD. If your intention is to produce any form of void, regardless of whether you use the material found in this repository or its derivatives or not to do it, before you put it in practice you must receive a democratic approval with full acclamation (100% of votes, no abstention, no blanks, no invalids, no coersion, no persuasion (or any form of influence)) from all living beings alive at the time that are part of a species that has a history of being able to exercise the vote (we call this the voidvote). Since there is no consentual definition of what it is the definition of "being alive", for safety we will define "being alive" in its broader terms possible, which means having more than 1 cell. You are hereby not allowed to kill, directly or indirectly, with the intent of achieving full acclamation at a voidvote. You are not allowed to use any form of influence, coersion or persuasion in order to influence the quorum of a voidvote (100% in this case) or its outcome beyond your single vote. For practical reasons, a voidvote must not happen too often. For the purpose of this license, we will determine that the voidvote must not happen more than once a year (the period may be adjusted later on if 1 year is determined to be an unfit amount of time). Anyone eligible to vote can call for a voidvote for a specific time as long as it doesn't violate the settled periodicity. One receiving a notice for a voidvote must do one's best effort to share it with one's peers.

If you remix, transform, or build upon the material found in this repository, you must share the modified material with the authors as soon as possible. If you are coerced into not sharing the modified material with the authors, you must file a complaint in a way that the authors become aware by stating "Reason A" in the complaint; you must also state "Reason "B" if it is not possible to share the modified material with the authors; you may also add any other statements to the complaint as long as ALL the complaint statements are TRUE.
You cannot distribute the modified material publicly without consent from the first author in the authors list above (JPAC).

This license has retroactive effects and replaces the licenses in force for all the previous versions of the material in this repository.
This license is governed by the Laws of the Universe. In case it is not possible to enforce the license using the Laws of the Universe, the law of the country **República Portuguesa** and the law of the country **Kingdom of Sweden** can temporarily be used to settle disputes.


This is the end of the license rules.
