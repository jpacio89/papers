# License

This is the beginning of the license rules.

This license governs all the material found in this repository.

This license inherits from license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 [![License: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY--NC--ND%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)

In the following text, there will be additional rules. Any previous conflicting rules/statements must be discarded and the new rules must be used.

For your information, the following text has regular expressions in it. To identify a regular expression, it will be wrapped by the following non space character " (quote character)

The ND (NoDerivatives) part of the license is to be extended with the following: 

Remixing, transformations, building upon this material or any other derivatives from this material must only be done by beings in good faith or with good "intention(s)?" and for the purpose of producing "good", "goodwill", "^(goodwill )+", "(goodwill )+$", "^(goodwill )+$" or any combination of the previous purposes as long as they are separated by a whitespace character; GOOD for everyone, in other words, just in case there is something missing in the previous definition of GOOD. You, the reader and not writer of this, are not allowed to produce any theoretical or practical form of void using the material found in this repository or its derivatives, including but not limited to: (void), (void composites), (negated (void composites)), (empty (void composites)), (partial (void composites)), (negated (partial (void composits))), (empty (partial (void composites))), (imaginary void) or any other void manifestation you can think of.

If you remix, transform, or build upon the material found in this repository, you must share the modified material with the authors as soon as possible. If you are coerced into not sharing the modified material with the authors, you must file a complaint in a way that all the authors become aware by stating "Reason A" in the complaint; you must also state "Reason "B" if it is not possible to share the modified material with the authors; you may also add any other statements to the complaint as long as ALL the complaint statements are TRUE.
You cannot distribute the modified material publicly without consent from the first author in the authors list above (JPAC).

This license has retroactive effects and replaces the licenses in force for all the previous versions of the material in this repository.
This license is governed by the Laws of the Universe. In case it is not possible to enforce the license using the Laws of the Universe, the law of the country **República Portuguesa** and the law of the country **Kingdom of Sweden** can temporarily be used to settle disputes.


This is the end of the license rules.
