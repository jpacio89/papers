Also, you, the reader and not writer of the material found in this repository, are not allowed to produce any form or variation of infinity, including but not limited to theoretical infinity or practical infinity, using the material found in this repository or its derivatives, including but not limited to: (infinity), (infinity composites), (negated (infinity composites)), (empty (infinity composites)), (partial (infinity composites)), (negated (partial (infinity composites))), (empty (partial (infinity composites))), (imaginary infinity) or any other infinity manifestation or infinity concept you can think of.

If you are coerced into not sharing the modified material with the authors, you must file a complaint in a way that all the authors become aware by stating "Reason A" in the complaint; you must also state "Reason "B" if it is not possible to share the modified material with the authors; you may also add any other statements to the complaint as long as ALL the complaint statements are TRUE.

Remixing, transformations, building upon this material or any other derivatives from this material is only allowed to happen after 1st of January of the year 2025 AD.

The latest license supersedes all previous licenses for the material in this repository (including its previous versions). To define latest, old, new and previous one must use the Universal Clock, which is absolute.

This license, the repository and its contents are governed by the Laws of the Universe.
